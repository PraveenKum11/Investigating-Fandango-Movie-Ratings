# Investigating fandango movie ratings for deceitful rating increase

* This is a Guided Project form DataQuest.

* In this project I have cleaned the data, created multiple visulizations and make crucial conclusions.  
+ **What the project is about?**  
In this project we are going to analyse the fandango movie rating to see if the movie ratings are still inflated, after it was once discovered by Walt Hickey(in 2015) that they inflate movie ratings.  

+ **What your goal is in this project?**  
The goal is to investigate and find weather fandango still inflates movie ratings (which implies that they made a false statement in 2015 saying it was a bug which inflated the movie ratings) or the ratings are normal.


# Conclusions  
+ From our analysis this is clear that, indeed there is a difference btw the fandango 2015 rating and fandango 2016 ratings.At last we also found out that the mean rating decreased by 5% for the popular movies.  
+ This can very well be the result of fandango fixing the biased rating system after the Hickey's analysis.
